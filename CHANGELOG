openengsb-maven-plugin-2.3.1 2011-12-23
--------------------------------------------

This release was only required to make it possible to get a clean documentation on the homepage (which required
openengsb-root-28, which on the other hand required openengsb-maven-plugin-2.3.0).

### Details
** Library Upgrade
    * [OPENENGSB-2458] - Upgrade to root-28
    * [OPENENGSB-2459] - Reactivate source parsing

** Task
    * [OPENENGSB-2456] - Release openengsb-maven-plugin 2.3.1


openengsb-maven-plugin-2.3.0 2011-12-23
--------------------------------------------

The third feature release cut from the 2.x release series comes with great new features concerning the documentation.
With this plugin a new goal (extractSource) had been added which allows to tag source code and automatically generate
docbook src from it. In addition we've upgraded various libraries and included the documentation now directly into the
project. There's also a source package now providing the tagged source as is for building/modifying the plugin locally.
